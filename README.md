Linux post exploitation tool for info gathering and exfiltration.  



## Abstract  
`Vermilion` is a simple and lightweight CLI tool designed for rapid collection, and optional exfiltration of sensitive information from Linux systems.  
Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of gathering critical data in red teaming scenarios.  


> [!CAUTION]  
> This tool is in the early stages of development; as such, it may contain bugs or unhandled edge cases.    
> Vermilion has been designed as a resource for red teaming campaigns and/or educational purposes.  
> The author assumes no responsibility for the weaponization of this tool or the improper handling of sensitive data collected through its use.  


## How It Works  
Vermilion collects system information and sensitive directories/files, such as `.ssh`, `.bash/zsh_history`, `.aws`, `.docker`, `.kube`, `.azure`, `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` , and more, then creates a compressed archive containing them. 

Additionally, it provides the option to exfiltrate the collected data via an HTTP `POST` request to a specified endpoint.   

The implementation of the endpoint for exfiltration is outside the scope of this tool; for an example, refer to [*this*](https://github.com/R3DRUN3/sploitcraft/tree/main/red-team-infra#deploy-a-lambda-function-for-data-exfiltration) resource.
